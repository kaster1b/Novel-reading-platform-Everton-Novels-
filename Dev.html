				<h3>News about comment and login function by everton novels</h3><br><br>
			<i>The comment and login function will be soon available to desktop and mobile users. The reason for the delay of such an crucial is due to many reasons but just saying this would make it seem as i am just maing a excuse so the reasons are as follows:</i><br><br>
			<ol>
				<li>lack of manpower.<br>
				Even though we have many people that are 'working' in this website other people seem to disapper just when they are needed or their desktop just stops working or is not there in existance.</li>
				<li>Short deadline<br>
				What made this website so hard to make is finding all the chapters for the newly posted or completed novels and also due to many 'problems' faced by other members causing lack of manpower it would require more time which 'we' couldnot afford so hence this working but incomplete website.
